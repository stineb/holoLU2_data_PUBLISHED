# Data from Stocker et al., 2017

This repository contains all time series data for the peatland carbon balance and land use change emissions as published in Stocker et al., 2017.
Available files:
- `dcpeat_lpx_stocker17pnas.csv` : Global total peatland annual net ecosystem productivity and carbon storage in peatland soils, simulated by LPX (DYPTOP module, Stocker et al., 2014, GMD)
- `dcpeat_yml_stocker17pnas.csv` : Global total peatland net carbon balance, derived from 64 dated peat cores, termed 'YML' in Stocker et al., 2017. Includes summary statistics from 1000 individual reconstructions.
- `dcpeat_cum_yml_stocker17pnas.csv` : Global total cumulative peatland net carbon balance, derived from 64 dated peat cores, termed 'YML' in Stocker et al., 2017. Includes summary statistics from 1000 individual reconstructions.
- `luc_co2_emissions_stocker17pnas.csv` : Annual and cumulative CO2 emissions from land use change following different scenarios (HYDE 3.1, HYDE 3.2, KK10 and KK10D)
